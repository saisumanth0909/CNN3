# Things to try:

## Look at the data!
  - How is it distributed?  How well would a random model do?
  - Can the model learn on a tiny subset of the data?
## Better models
  - Better architecture
## Data cleanup
  - Normalize
## Data generation
  - https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/
## Reduce learning rate on plateau
  - https://keras.io/callbacks/#reducelronplateau
## Find more training data online?
## Anything else?
